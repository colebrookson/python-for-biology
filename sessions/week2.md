## Week 2
This week we will cover the **essential** skills of reading and writing if-statements, looping actions, and functions. Please watch the below videos and follow along in your own Google Collab notebook, writing code and/or taking notes when appropriate. The point of the in-person session will be to practice the skills you'll get an overview of in these videos. As with all these videos, please feel free to pause to digest when you need or watch on a different speed using the YouTube playback speed functionality. These videos will give you an *introduction* to these topics, and during our synchronous session, we'll cement the ideas introduced here with lots of examples and exercises for you to complete.

### If-statements

A near-universal programming concept is to ask your computer to do something (i.e. complete a `statement`), but only `if` a particular condition applies. This simple but powerful concept allows us to control exactly when particular actions occur in a script, and can be used in tandem with the other concepts covered this week to achieve a particular programming task in a robust, and consistent manner.

### Looping actions

Asking Python to iterate (or 'loop') over a particular set of functions a number of times is a basic and important functionality that is used commonly. There are a variety of looping actions, and they can involve a series of more complex sub-arguments, but here we cover the broad concept of loops, as well as some of the most common structures, like the *while loop* and the *for loop*.

### Functions

Functions are the building blocks of well-written programs in Python, and indeed most other OOP languages. A function allows you to perform the same actions over and over again with different inputs, while maintaining a consistent method, and avoiding error propagation that comes with copying and pasting code.
