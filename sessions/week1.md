## Week 1

Topics of this week will be an introduction to this series, an overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and some of the basic programming skills that will form the basis of what we'll learn from here on out.

Please watch the below videos **before** coming to the synchronous lecture - they are very short. Follow along when asked, and write down any questions or difficulties you have that we can discuss in lecture.



Please [click here](https://forms.gle/4RCiyEQWxAP9jVDz7) to fill out the post-session feedback form here! We take your feedback into account in real time, so any changes we can make to help you learn better next week we will make!


After the session, there will be a static page here with a full summary of what was learned this week:
