## Week 1

Welcome to the first week of content! Topics of this week will be an introduction to this series, an overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and some of the basic programming skills that will form the basis of what we'll learn from here on out.

Please watch the below videos **before** coming to the synchronous lecture - they are relatively short. Follow along when asked, and write down any questions or difficulties you have that we can discuss in lecture.

In future weeks, we'll have a few videos for you to watch that have programming concepts or ideas presented, that we will then practice in our synchronous session. This week, we are just getting you set up to be ready to code, and we'll do everything else together in our session! Looking forward to seeing you all soon!

### Introduction to Google Collab

Some of you who have programmed before may recognize the terms IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or text editor. These are tools often used by programmers to write and run their code, and typically they are applications installed on one's local computer. While we encourage you to research and set up your own IDE if you plan on programming much past this workshop series (some useful links in the [Resources](/resources/) section), we ask that you all use Google Collab for this series, just so we're all on the same page technology-wise. This video will walk you through the very basics of using [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
