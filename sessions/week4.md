## Week 4

**ZOOM LINK:** [https://ualberta-ca.zoom.us/j/94407584174](https://ualberta-ca.zoom.us/j/94407584174)

This week we're going to be doing a very brief introduction to working with data in Python. While there are lots of ways to deal with data in Python, the most common method is through the library Pandas. You can learn more about Pandas (here)[https://pandas.pydata.org] if you're interested.  We're going to go over some basic data operations and how to deal with larger datasets in Python.

In this video, Cole will walk you through how we'll be loading data into Google Colab so it's accessible to us to work with.
